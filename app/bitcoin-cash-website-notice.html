        <p>Due to the decentralized nature of the BCH network, there is no official reference website for general Bitcoin Cash information. Unfortunately, the most popular of those informational websites, bitcoincash.org, has been publishing information that does not reflect the current reality of the BCH network and the November 15th scheduled upgrade.</p>

        <p>Bitcoin ABC, which owns bitcoincash.org, wants to implement an 8% miner tax. This proposal has been rejected by the vast majority of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem, and Bitcoin ABC will likely to fork to a minority chain as a new coin. This reality has already been recognized in statements from Bitgo, Coinbase, Kraken, and others. Unfortunately, Bitcoin ABC is still presenting their software as the only “compatible” software for the November 15th upgrade.</p>

        <p>Please replace any references to bitcoincash.org with an alternative, such as bch.info.</p>

        <p>In order for services stay on the BCH network, it is also necessary to replace any Bitcoin ABC nodes with an alternative such as Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN), and to make sure it’s an up to date version that’s compatible with the November 15th upgrade. This upgrade will make Bitcoin Cash block times more reliable.</p>
